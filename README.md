Here you can find the MATLAB code for the algorithm described in the paper, [Position-based kinematics for 7-DoF serial manipulators with global configuration control, joint limit and singularity avoidance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094114X17306559).

The code was developed and tested with the kinematic structure of a KUKA iiwa R800.

I highly recommend installing the Peter Corke's Robotics Toolbox (https://petercorke.com/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox/).
