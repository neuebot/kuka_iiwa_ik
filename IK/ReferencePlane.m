% REFERENCEPLANE
% 
% Calculates the vector normal to the reference plane.
% A virtual robotic manipulator is created with the same structure as the
% real robot, but keeping its joint3 = 0.
%
% From the current end-effector position and robot configuration, it
% computes the set of joint positions for the virtual manipulator (i.e. theta_3=0)
% With this we compute the plane of the virtual Shoulder-Elbow-Wrist, which
% is the reference plane. The NSParam is calculated from the angle between
% the actual robot Shoulder-Elbow-Wrist plane and the reference plane.
%
% Input:  pose            - Homogeneous Matrix size(4,4) of current robot pose
%         rconf           - Robot Configuration 8-bit number
% Output: ref_plan_vector - Vector normal to the reference plane.
%         rot_base_elbow  - Rotation Matrix size(3,3) from base to elbow
%         joints          - Joint values of the virtual robot (debug)
%
% The robot configuration parameter is considered because there is usually
% 2 possible solutions: elbow 'up' and 'down'. Therefore and as the author
% suggested we are selecting the configuration that matches the current
% robot.
